eid-mw-sdk-delphi is a translation of C code from 
https://github.com/Fedict/eid-mw/tree/master/doc/sdk/examples/C
to Delphi.

The main goal is to make the Delphi code as close as possible to
the original C code of Fedict.

It should work with all versions of Delphi and even with 
Lazarus/FreePascal.

Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.
